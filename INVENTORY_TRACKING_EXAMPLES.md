# Inventory Tracking - How It Works

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: We Track ACTUAL UNITS, Not Liters!

The system tracks **physical units** (jerry cans, bottles, boxes) - NOT liters or milliliters.

---

## Example 1: Jerry Cans (5L Liquid Soap)

### Initial Stock
- You receive: **50 jerry cans** of 5L liquid soap
- You enter in system: **Stock = 50**
- Each jerry can contains 5 liters (this is just for display/reference)

### After Sales
- Customer buys: **3 jerry cans**
- System deducts: **3 units**
- New stock: **47 jerry cans**

### What You Count
When doing physical inventory:
- Count the actual jerry cans: 1, 2, 3, 4... 47
- Enter: **Stock = 47**
- ❌ Don't calculate: 47 × 5L = 235L
- ✅ Just count: **47 jerry cans**

---

## Example 2: Bottles (500ml Handwash)

### Initial Stock
- You receive: **200 bottles** of 500ml handwash
- You enter in system: **Stock = 200**

### After Sales
- Customer 1 buys: **5 bottles**
- Customer 2 buys: **10 bottles**
- Total sold: **15 bottles**
- New stock: **185 bottles**

### Physical Count
- Count bottles on shelf: **185 bottles**
- That's it! No conversion needed.

---

## Example 3: Boxes (Box of 4 × 5L)

### Initial Stock
- You receive: **20 boxes** (each box contains 4 jerry cans of 5L)
- You enter in system: **Stock = 20 boxes**

### After Sales
- Hotel buys: **3 boxes**
- System deducts: **3 boxes**
- New stock: **17 boxes**

### Important Notes
- You track **boxes**, not individual cans inside
- If you open a box, you need to decide:
  - Option A: Keep tracking as boxes (0.75 boxes if you sell 1 can from a box)
  - Option B: Break down box into individual 5L cans and track separately

## Example 4: Mixed Sales

### Product: 20L Jerry Can (Tiles Cleaner)
**Initial:** 30 jerry cans

### Sales Today:
1. Regular client buys **2 jerry cans** → Stock: 28
2. Random client buys **1 jerry can** → Stock: 27
3. Regular client buys **5 jerry cans** → Stock: 22

### End of Day:
- Physical count: **22 jerry cans**
- System shows: **22 units**
- ✅ Perfect match!

## Stock Management Examples

### Restocking
**Scenario:** You receive new delivery

**Before:**
- 5L Liquid Soap: **15 jerry cans**

**Delivery:**
- Receive: **50 new jerry cans**

**After:**
- Update stock to: **65 jerry cans**
- System adds: +50 units

### Low Stock Alert
**Settings:**
- Product: 500ml Handwash Bottle
- Minimum stock: **20 bottles**
- Current stock: **18 bottles**

**Alert:** ⚠️ Low Stock! Only 18 bottles remaining

**Action:** Order more bottles

## Sales Recording - Step by Step

### Scenario: Hotel Orders Liquid Soap

**Step 1:** Select Product
- Product: "Century Liquid Soap 5L"
- Unit: Jerry Can
- Size: 5L (just for display)

**Step 2:** Select Client
- Client: "Hotel Mille Collines" (Regular)
- Price automatically shows: **2,000 RWF per jerry can**

**Step 3:** Enter Quantity
- Quantity: **10** (meaning 10 jerry cans)
- Total: 10 × 2,000 = **20,000 RWF**

**Step 4:** Complete Sale
- Stock before: 65 jerry cans
- Stock after: **55 jerry cans**
- System deducts: **10 units**

## Inventory Count Sheet Example

### Daily Physical Count

| Product | Unit Type | Count | System Stock | Match? |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 5L Liquid Soap | Jerry Can | 55 | 55 | ✅ |
| 20L Liquid Soap | Jerry Can | 22 | 22 | ✅ |
| 500ml Handwash | Bottle | 180 | 185 | ❌ -5 |
| 1L Tiles Cleaner | Bottle | 45 | 45 | ✅ |
| Box of 4 (5L) | Box | 17 | 17 | ✅ |

**Discrepancy Found:**
- 500ml Handwash: Missing 5 bottles
- Action: Investigate (damaged? stolen? recording error?)

---

## Key Principles

### ✅ DO:
- Count actual physical units (cans, bottles, boxes)
- Track what you can physically touch and count
- Update stock when you receive deliveries
- Deduct stock when you make sales
- Do regular physical counts

### ❌ DON'T:
- Convert to liters for stock tracking
- Calculate total liquid volume
- Mix units (don't add bottles + cans)
- Forget to update stock after sales

## Summary

**Think like a warehouse manager:**
- "I have 55 jerry cans on the shelf"
- "I sold 10 jerry cans today"
- "I need to order more when I have less than 20 jerry cans"

**NOT like a chemist:**
- ❌ "I have 275 liters of soap"
- ❌ "I sold 50 liters today"

**The size (5L, 20L, 500ml) is just a label on the product for customers to know what they're buying!**
